        <h2>CSS Transitions</h2>
        <p>CSS transitions give you a seamless approach to animate changes to element attributes, improving user interfaces with smooth, gradual animations. This feature allows objects to transition between states over a specific amount of time, improving user interactions by giving feedback and visual appeal. Developers may design changing, responsive online experiences that are simple yet engaging simply choosing which attributes should animate, as well as their length and timing.</p>
        <p>Transitions are used not only for aesthetic purposes, but also as practical aids, leading users through interactions via subtle visual signals. For example, a button's colour change on hover might suggest interaction, making online navigating easier. This deliberate use of transitions increases usability, making digital surroundings more accessible and navigable.   </p>
        <p>CSS transitions are built on timing functions, which provide fine control over the animation's tempo. These functions can simulate real-world dynamics, such as the natural slowing of moving objects, making web interactions more realistic. This control converts static sites into clear, interactive areas, making digital material engaging.</p>
        <p>While CSS transitions are effective, they are best suited for simple animations with clear start and finish points. For elaborate animations or interactive sequences, CSS animations or JavaScript may be more appropriate. Nonetheless, CSS transitions are an important feature of online design, achieving a balance between usability and the capacity to build visually appealing and adaptable site elements.</p>

        <h2>CSS variables</h2>
        <p>CSS variables, often known as custom properties, help to ease style maintenance across several web projects. They let developers to specify reusable variables, like as colours or typefaces, simplifying site-wide design changes to a few variable values. This centralized control decreases the labour required for changes while also ensuring uniformity across a website. </p>
        <p>CSS variables may be used globally or to individual components, allowing for greater style freedom. This implies that a single variable can have multiple values in different portions of a document, allowing for more flexible design approaches while reducing the need for duplicate code and improving style maintainability and adaptability.  </p>
        <p>They are essential for flexible designs and interactive themes, allowing styles to adjust to different screen sizes and user preferences with ease. CSS variables allow styles to change dynamically in response to media queries or user interactions, with real-time changes via JavaScript, enhancing the user experience with minimum development work.
        </p>
        <p>CSS variables are straightforward to implement and supported by all recent browsers, making them a solid development tool. They provide a powerful yet simple way for creating dynamic, maintainable, and scalable websites, representing a considerable improvement in online design efficiency and creativity.
